Online MP servers for Black & White (2001) 

## Synopsis

The official servers for Black & White were shut down in 2005, this project is an attempt to emulate them completely
to allow multiplayer connectivity across the internet for anyone and
to offer the same services provided between 2001-2005 by bwgame.com
